# Vinny Almost Misses Christmas
Source project for the Half-Life: Alyx map "Vinny Almost Misses Christmas".

Being my first map there is bound to be a ton of inefficient mapping methods so feel free to give feedback on things being done incorrectly or if you know of any fixes for the issues noted in the map.

If you want to compile and run this map for yourself there are two things you need to do first:

1. Two folders are in the **content** folder for convenience sake during development but must be in the **game** folder when the game runs:
	* scripts/
	* panorama/videos/

2. Two models along with their textures are excluded due to their strict licenses. They will show up as giant errors in the map and will need to be replaced with any generic models that can fit in their place.
